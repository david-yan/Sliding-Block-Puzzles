Things to do:
1. Design graph traversal
  - works the same as the path method in Graph.java in lab21. 
2. Design implementation of board
  - thinking possibly using a 2D array like in checkers with an array of all the blocks
  - each space would store the index of the block that is on it
  - need to implement a toString method of Board to match that specified in the project description
  - handles all movement
    - canMove: has a piece that can move
    - possibleMoves: list of all possible moves (probably returns the starting position of a piece and the ending position of the piece
    - move: return the resulting board of moving one piece
    - equals: for checking repeating configurations
      - possibly using hashCode to check to keep comparison running as fast as possible
      - also stores hashCode inside board and updates hashCode with move
3. Design implementation of block
  - stores dimensions of block
  - stores position of this
  - implements toString to help board.toString
4. TESTING
  - TESTING
    -TESTING
